# Advent of Code 2021 Solutions

Fairly messy and potentially suboptimal solutions to [AOC21](https://adventofcode.com/2021).

* `solutions` contains the raw python solutions used to get on the leaderboard
    - these solutions exercise no restraint in package/module usage
* `publish` contains slightly more civilized and cleaned-up python solutions
    - these solutions run on demo input by default (change last line if needed)
* `cpp` contains cpp solutions (experimental)
* `inputs` contains the problem inputs

> tested on Python 3.8.10
