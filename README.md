# Advent of Code 2021 Solutions

Fairly messy and potentially suboptimal solutions to AOC21.

* `solutions` contains the raw python solutions used to get on the leaderboard
* `publish` contains slightly more civilized and cleaned-up python solutions
* `cpp` contains cpp solutions (experimental)
* `inputs` contains the puzzle inputs

> Python solutions exercise no restraint in package/module usage (built-in or external)

> Python solutions run on demo input by default
